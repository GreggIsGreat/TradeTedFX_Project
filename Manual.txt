# Trading Script Manual

## Overview
This document outlines the goals, requirements, and functionality of the Python trading script designed for market analysis and price prediction.

## Goals

1. **Historical Data Collection** 
   - Capture candlestick information for configurable time periods (default: 60 days) ✅
   - Store OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data efficiently ✅
   - Support multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 1d) ✅

3. **Trading Session Management** 
   - Maintain active trading sessions with proper state management 
   - Implement session logging and monitoring

4. **News Integration**
   - Fetch relevant financial news from multiple sources
   - Perform sentiment analysis on news articles
   - Correlate news events with price movements
   - Filter news by relevance and impact level

5. **Risk Management**
   - Implement position sizing algorithms
   - Set stop-loss and take-profit levels
   - Monitor portfolio exposure and diversification
   - Calculate risk-reward ratios for trades

6. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - Stream live market data
   - Generate alerts for trading opportunities
   - Monitor system performance and latency
   - Provide dashboard interface for oversight

2. **Price Prediction System**
   - Implement machine learning models for closing price prediction
   - Use technical indicators as feature inputs
   - Apply best practices for time series forecasting
   - Include confidence intervals and prediction accuracy metrics

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements
